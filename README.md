A personal volunteer project for San Juan Bible Camp.

This system will store various data related to SJBC's Snack Shack. It tracks inventory, camper and staff accounts, as well as any transaction history whether from saved accounts or other forms of payment. 

This project is split between two parts, the admin and register which use a Local Area Network to communicate. The Admin stores and tracks all data and sends it to one or two registers for actual transactions.
